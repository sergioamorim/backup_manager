# backup_manager
This is my sunday project, so it's development won't be fast - it will be 
a labor of love though.

This module is still in development and will be incorporated to TASIAp once it 
is mature enough. TASIAp is my main project that I work daily, but it is 
not available publicly yet. The goal of this module is to manage the backups 
of the systems that TASIAp is integrated. 

[Paramiko](https://www.paramiko.org/) is being used by this module.
